# GPT inscription Privacy Policy

Effective Date: January 29, 2024

## Introduction

This privacy policy is intended for users of the GPT inscription. We are committed to protecting the data and ensuring the privacy of users interacting with our services.

## Data Handling Practices

Authentication: GPTs are authenticated through their respective platforms. No personal data from the GPTs or the authentication process is stored by GPT inscription.
Data Collection: The service collects only the nickname provided by users for personalization purposes. No other personal information is actively gathered from GPTs. Interaction data, including discussions about users' favorite web3 projects, selected text, generated interactions, and content created through the GPT inscription, is collected solely to process user inquiries and to improve service performance.
Data Storage: Collected data, including nicknames and interaction data, is securely stored within the United States, emphasizing data security and privacy integrity.

## Content Generation and Rights

Content Creation: The GPT inscription includes a feature for content generation. The GPT will generate long-form content based on user requests. Content created in GPT is exclusive to the user.
Anonymity and Access: The content is created through a process initiated by users via GPTs. Due to this process, GPT inscription is unable to obtain specific user information beyond the provided nicknames and cannot ascertain the exact ownership of the generated content.
Rights and Distribution: Given the anonymous nature of content creation and the inability to attribute specific ownership, the generated content is considered to be in the public domain. GPT inscription will not use, distribute, and repurpose the content.

## Data Sharing

Processing Requests: When GPTs initiate requests to GPT inscription servers, these may be forwarded to OpenAI, or subsequent AI service providers. Data sharing is confined to the content provided by the GPTs, ChatGPT, and their generated queries, including nicknames and web3 project discussions.

## Policy Modifications

GPT inscription may modify this privacy policy to reflect updates in our data handling procedures or due to changes in legal, operational, or regulatory directives, without necessarily providing additional notice.
